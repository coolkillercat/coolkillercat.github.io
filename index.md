# About Me

<img src="xinyini.jpeg" class="floatpic">

Hello! I’m **Xinyi Ni(倪心逸)**.  
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/), advised by [Prof. Pengyu Hong](https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~hong/). My research focuses on **Large Language Model (LLM) agents** and **automatic tool generation** from unstructured REST API documentation. I am particularly interested in making AI agents more capable, reliable, and universally applicable across domains.  

I earned my B.A. in Financial Mathematics from Soochow University, where I built a strong analytical and quantitative foundation. During that time, I studied as a visiting student at **UC Berkeley**, taking courses in data structures, algorithms, and machine learning, which sparked my passion for artificial intelligence and intelligent systems.  

I am always open to research collaborations and job opportunities. Feel free to reach out with email!
